/*  DID NOT REALIZE THIS!!!
    Apparently the way you instantiate jQuery has changed
    as of V3.
    
    Code below is the OLD WAY of doing it:
    
    $(document).ready(function()
    {
    
    });
    
    
    THIS IS NOW THE *NEW WAY* OF DOING IT...MUCH SIMPLER!!!
    
    $(function()
    {
    
    });

$(function()
{
    
});
